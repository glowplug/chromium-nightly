This is a fork of the AUR chromium-browser-bin package [0]. It is renamed to
"chromium-nightly", and its binary and directory is changed from "chromium" to
"chromium-nightly".

Those changes allow this package to be installed side by side with the official
extra/chromium package. This package will cease to exist when the original
chromium-browser-bin package allows this usage. Meanwhile, feel free to send
pull requests, as I have very little knowledge about maintaining packages.
